This package allows you to fit Maximum Entropy Optimality Theory models to data 
sets, generate the predictions made by such models for novel data, and compare 
the fit of different models using a variety of metrics. This package is still in
development, and is being prepared for submission to CRAN.

The authors of this package are [Connor Mayer](http://connormayer.com), [Adeline Tan](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/adeline-tan/), 
and [Kie Zuraw](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/zuraw/).

## Citing maxent.ot
If you publish work that uses `maxent.ot`, please cite this repository.

> ```Mayer, C., Tan, A., & Zuraw, K.(2022). maxent.ot: A package for doing Maximum Entropy Optimality Theory in R (Version 0.1.0) [Computer software]. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7246367```


## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of maxent.ot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("maxent.ot")
```
-->
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}
if (!require(maxent.ot)) {
  devtools::install_github("connormayer/maxent.ot")
}
```
## Example

This is a simple example workflow of fitting two MaxEnt OT models to the same
data (with different constraint sets), examining their predicted frequencies, 
and comparing their fits using the likelihood ratio test.

```{r example}
library(maxent.ot)

# Get paths to input files.
# This file has two constraints
data_file_simple <- system.file(
   "extdata", "sample_data_file_small.txt", package = "maxent.ot"
)
# This file has three constraints
data_file_complex <- system.file(
   "extdata", "sample_data_file_large.txt", package = "maxent.ot"
)

# Fit weights to both data sets with simple regularization
simple_model <- optimize_weights(data_file_simple, mu_scalar=0, sigma_scalar=10)
complex_model <- optimize_weights(data_file_complex, mu_scalar=0, sigma_scalar=10)

# Examine predicted probabilities of each model
simple_predictions <- predict_probabilities(data_file_simple, simple_model$weights)
complex_predictions <- predict_probabilities(data_file_complex, complex_model$weights)

# Compare model fit to training data using the likelihood ratio test
compare_models(simple_model, complex_model, method='lrt')
```

<!--What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
