Description: Fit Maximum Entropy Optimality Theory models to data sets,
  generate the predictions made by such models for novel data, and compare the 
  fit of different models using a variety of metrics. The package is described
  in Mayer, C., Tan, A., Zuraw, K. (in press) <https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~cjmayer/papers/cmayer_et_al_maxent_ot_accepted.pdf>.
